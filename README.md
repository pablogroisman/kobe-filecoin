# kobe-filecoin

This project leverages the power of the FEVM (Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine) to deploy smart contracts and store crucial data in a decentralized manner using Filecoin.

## Smart Contracts Deployment

We have successfully deployed three smart contracts on the Calibration testnet. You can view one of the deployed contracts at the following link:

## Data Storage in Filecoin

### Embeddings from RAG Model

Our project incorporates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that processes and embeds the blockchain's documentation. These embeddings were converted into `.car` files and uploaded to Filecoin, ensuring secure and decentralized storage.

### User Conversations Data

We are committed to protecting our users' data by storing it in a decentralized manner. The data from user conversations will also be uploaded to Filecoin, following the same process used for the embeddings.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the necessary files and configurations to deploy smart contracts on the FEVM and handle data storage operations using Filecoin
